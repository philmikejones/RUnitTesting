## Why test?

See the [Testing chapter of Advanced R](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) for a full discussion of why we should test our outputs, but to summarise:

- Testing helps us discover bugs; we can't fix what we don't know isn't broken.
- Fewer bugs $\approx$ greater confidence in our code and outputs
- Ensure we don't break something when we introduce new code
- Prevent this just before publication:

## What to test?

We should ideally test as much code output as is useful and possible.
In a data analysis project, that will usually boil down to:

- Data preparation scripts, and
- Functions

We don't need to test everything.
Instead, prioritise functions and code blocks that are more complex, are more fragile, or that depend on or feed into other blocks of code.
But, be careful not to assume the output of a block of code is obvious:

```{r vector-test}
x <- 1:5
attr(x, "label") <- letters[1:5]
is.vector(x)
```

By way of explanation, `is.vector()` only returns `TRUE` if the object is a vector and has no attributes apart from `names` (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html#vectors)


## Data analysis scripts - testing inline

For data analysis scripts I recommend you add checks to your script as you go along.
You're probably already checking your results so it's often just a case of writing the tests explicitly in your script rather than testing interactively.

I find tests are most useful when I'm doing something that could change the data without me realising, such as:

- Any joins or merges - ALWAYS check you have the right number of cases!
- Where you change the type of an object, especially when going from character to numeric, or numeric to logical.
- Where `NA`s might be introduced, such as a `full_join()`. `assertthat::noNA()` is useful for this.
- When dealing with factors, especially with numbers as factor levels (is it `1.0`, or is it factor level `1`?).

The example tests here are relatively trivial, but are only designed to show you how to test, not *what* to test.
Let's load the packages we need and save some data to a temporary directory demonstrate.
The data is very close to my heart and is available from the [International Coffee Organization](http://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp):

```{r packages, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
library("stringr")
library("assertthat")
```

```{r download-data}
temp_dir <- tempdir()
temp <- tempfile(tmpdir = temp_dir, fileext = ".xlsx")
download.file(
  "http://www.ico.org/historical/1990%20onwards/Excel/2b%20-%20Imports.xlsx",
  destfile = temp
)
```

```{r coffee-skip}
coffee <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(temp, skip = 3) %>% 
  rename(country = "Calendar years") %>% 
  select(country, `2013`)
head(coffee)
```

You can no doubt see a number of problems, but lets see if we can pick this up with testing.
We can use base's `stopifnot()` or the `assertthat` package for tests.
Both do essentially the same thing, but you can add a customised error message with `assertthat::assert_that()` which is sometimes useful.

First I want to make sure there aren't any blank rows:

```{r test-blank-row}
assertthat::noNA(coffee$country)
```

On seeing this I would amend my script and, when re-run, hopefully the test will pass:

```{r fix-blank-rows}
coffee <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(temp, skip = 3) %>% 
  rename(country = "Calendar years") %>% 
  select(country, `2013`) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(country))

assertthat::noNA(coffee$country)
```

Next, I know from opening the Excel file there are 34 countries with data, so lets check:

```{r test-n-countries}
assertthat::are_equal(nrow(coffee), 34L)  # 'L' is for integer, obviously
```

This test fails because there are a number of observations that aren't counties, such as the European Union, a `Total`, and the copyright information for the data.
There's also a '`Belgium/Luxembourg`' row where the data for these countries was combined in earlier years.
Lets remove these and re-test (first I'm going to save the total for a later test):

```{r fix-n-countries}
coffee_total <- 
  coffee %>% 
  filter(country == "Total") %>% 
  select(`2013`) %>% 
  as.numeric(.)

coffee <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(temp, skip = 3) %>% 
  rename(country = "Calendar years") %>% 
  select(country, `2013`) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>% 
  filter(
    country != "European Union",
    country != "Total",
    !str_detect(country, "International Coffee Organization"),
    country != "Belgium/Luxembourg"
  )

assertthat::are_equal(nrow(coffee), 34L)
```

Another problem fixed.
Now, lets see if everything adds up correctly:

```{r test-sum}
assertthat::are_equal(
  sum(coffee$`2013`), coffee_total
)
```

So, no.
But, the difference is pretty small so it's likely to be a rounding error.
We can change the tolerance of the test to make it pass in this case.
This means we can still include the test and, if we did something drastic to the data (like drop the USA by mistake) we'd still notice:

```{r test-sum-tolerance}
assertthat::are_equal(
  sum(coffee$`2013`), coffee_total,
  tol = 10
)
```
