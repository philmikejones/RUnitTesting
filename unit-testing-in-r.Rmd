## Why test?

See the [Testing chapter of Advanced R](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) for a full discussion of why we should test our outputs, but to summarise:

- Testing helps us discover bugs; we can't fix what we don't know isn't broken.
- Fewer bugs $\approx$ greater confidence in our code and outputs
- Ensure we don't break something when we introduce new code
- Prevent this just before publication:

## What to test?

We should ideally test as much code output as is useful and possible.
In a data analysis project, that will usually boil down to:

- Data preparation scripts, and
- Functions

We don't need to test everything.
Instead, prioritise functions and code blocks that are more complex, are more fragile, or that depend on or feed into other blocks of code.
But, be careful not to assume the output of a block of code is obvious:

```{r vector-test}
x <- 1:5
attr(x, "label") <- letters[1:5]
is.vector(x)
```

By way of explanation, `is.vector()` only returns `TRUE` if the object is a vector and has no attributes apart from `names` (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html#vectors)


## Data analysis scripts - testing inline

For data analysis scripts I recommend you add checks to your script as you go along.
You're probably already checking your results so it's often just a case of writing the tests explicitly in your script rather than testing interactively.

I find tests are most useful when I'm doing something that could change the data without me realising, such as:

- Any joins or merges - ALWAYS check you have the right number of cases!
- Where you change the type of an object, especially when going from character to numeric, or numeric to logical.
- Where `NA`s might be introduced, such as a `full_join()`. `assertthat::noNA()` is useful for this.
- When dealing with factors, especially with numbers as factor levels (is it `1.0`, or is it factor level `1`?).

The example tests here are relatively trivial, but are only designed to show you how to test, not *what* to test.
Let's load the packages we need and save some data to a temporary directory demonstrate.
The data is very close to my heart and is available from the [International Coffee Organization](http://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp):

```{r packages, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
suppressMessages(library("tidyverse"))
library("stringr")
library("assertthat")
```

```{r download-data}
temp_dir <- tempdir()
temp <- tempfile(tmpdir = temp_dir, fileext = ".xlsx")
download.file(
  "http://www.ico.org/historical/1990%20onwards/Excel/2b%20-%20Imports.xlsx",
  destfile = temp
)
```

```{r coffee-skip}
coffee <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(temp, skip = 3) %>% 
  rename(country = "Calendar years") %>% 
  select(country, `2013`)
head(coffee)
```

You can no doubt see a number of problems, but lets see if we can pick this up with testing.
We can use base's `stopifnot()` or the `assertthat` package for tests.
Both do essentially the same thing, but you can add a customised error message with `assertthat::assert_that()` which is sometimes useful.

First I want to make sure there aren't any blank rows:

```{r test-blank-row}
assertthat::noNA(coffee$country)
```

On seeing this I would amend my script and, when re-run, hopefully the test will pass:

```{r fix-blank-rows}
coffee <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(temp, skip = 3) %>% 
  rename(country = "Calendar years") %>% 
  select(country, `2013`) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(country))

assertthat::noNA(coffee$country)
```

Next, I know from opening the Excel file there are 34 countries with data, so lets check:

```{r test-n-countries}
assertthat::are_equal(nrow(coffee), 34L)  # 'L' is for integer, obviously
```

This test fails because there are a number of observations that aren't counties, such as the European Union, a `Total`, and the copyright information for the data.
There's also a '`Belgium/Luxembourg`' row where the data for these countries was combined in earlier years.
Lets remove these and re-test:

```{r fix-n-countries}
coffee <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(temp, skip = 3) %>% 
  rename(country = "Calendar years") %>% 
  select(country, `2013`) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>% 
  filter(
    country != "European Union",
    country != "Total",
    !str_detect(country, "International Coffee Organization"),
    country != "Belgium/Luxembourg"
  )

assertthat::are_equal(nrow(coffee), 34L)
```

Another problem fixed.
Now we have our script to prepare the data and our tests to make sure it's working as intended.
They should look something like this now:

```{r coffee-final}
coffee <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(temp, skip = 3) %>% 
  rename(country = "Calendar years") %>% 
  select(country, `2013`) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>% 
  filter(
    country != "European Union",
    country != "Total",
    !str_detect(country, "International Coffee Organization"),
    country != "Belgium/Luxembourg"
  )

assertthat::noNA(coffee$country)
assertthat::noNA(coffee$`2013`)
assertthat::are_equal(nrow(coffee), 34L)
```

![You are technically correct](img/technically_correct.jpg)

One of the advantages of having specified our tests is that if we go back and change something in our script and accidentally break something, the tests will alert us.
Imagine we accidentally remove one of the countries:

```{r coffee-remove-country}
coffee <- coffee[1:33, ]  # oops, we meant 34 (or even better nrow(coffee)!)
```

Now the tests will fail alerting us to the issue:

```{r coffee-test-remove-country}
assertthat::noNA(coffee$country)
assertthat::noNA(coffee$`2013`)
assertthat::are_equal(nrow(coffee), 34L)
```

## Testing functions

The other things you should test are functions.
Functions are useful to perform the same procedure on multiple objects.
Imagine we want to convert the units in our `coffee` table from its current 'thousands of 60kg bags' to simply kg.
Ordinarily in R we'd just do this as a vector operation, but lets write a function to illustrate the point.
Create the function in `R/` which we can do automatically with `usethis`:

```{r create-function-file, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_r("convert-unit")
```

The function itself should take a number, multiply it by 60, and multiply it by 1000:

```{r convert-bags-to-kg-function, eval=FALSE}
convert_bags_kg <- function(bags) {
  kg = bags * 60 * 1000
  kg
}
```

You can load functions in `R/` files with `devtools::load_all()`.

```{r load-function}
devtools::load_all()
```

Before we use the function, lets test it and make sure it produces the correct output.
I would expect 50 units in the coffee table to be equivalent to (50 $\times$ 60 $\times$ 1000 $=$) 3,000,000kg.
I would also expect that if the function encountered an `NA` it would return an `NA` (`NA` $\times$ 60 $\times$ 1000 $=$ `NA`!) so I'm also going to explicitly test for this.

Add a test to the `tests/` directory with:

```{r write-test-function, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_test("convert_bags_kg")
```

And run the test with `devtools::test()`:

```{r run-test}
devtools::test()
```

The output will tell you which (if any) tests fail and which pass.

Now we can confidently convert from thousands of 60kg bags to kg in the `coffee` data set:

```{r convert-coffee-bags-kg}
coffee <- 
  coffee %>% 
  mutate(kg = convert_bags_kg(`2013`)) %>% 
  select(country, kg)

head(coffee)
```

That's `r sum(coffee$kg)`kg of coffee in 2013, or `r coffee$kg[coffee$country == "United Kingdom"]`kg in the UK, of which I myself drank `r coffee$kg[coffee$country == "United Kingdom"] / 10`kg.

Again, the advantage of explicitly writing unit tests is that, if we modify the function and accidentally break its behaviour, the unit tests will alert us.
Try it and see!
